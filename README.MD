### **Build Your Legacy, Rule the Land**  
Imagine being dropped in **Medieval times**â€”armies, factions, and the risk of being left out. So why not **build your own guild** from the ground up and become ruler of the land with Guilder!

### **Tech Stack**
This project uses **Pharo with Small Talk** as its backend and database with a React FrontEnd. We used **Teapot** to make our restful APIs, with **Zinc Https** making calls to the Gemini API and used an object-oriented **Dictionaries** to act as our database. All the files are located in the **SmallTalk Directory**, Running init.playground.st followed by main.st in the Pharo 12.0 Playground will **start the server** on port 8085. You can use the **curl comands** listed at the top of main.st to test out the server.
